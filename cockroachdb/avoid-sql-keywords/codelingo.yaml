        title: Use Appropriate Verbs in Format
        body: |
          Prefer the most specific verb for your use. In other words, 
          prefer to avoid %v when possible. However, %v is to be used 
          when formatting bindings which might be nil and which do not 
          already handle nil formatting. Notably, nil errors formatted 
          as %s will render as "%!s()" while nil errors formatted as %v 
          will render as "". Therefore, prefer %v when formatting errors 
          which are not known to be non-nil.
