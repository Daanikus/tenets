        title: Avoid Annotations in Comments
        body: |
          Comments do not need extra formatting such as banners of stars. The generated output
          may not even be presented in a fixed-width font, so don't depend on spacing for alignmentâ€”godoc, 
          like gofmt, takes care of that. The comments are uninterpreted plain text, so HTML and other 
          annotations such as _this_ will reproduce verbatim and should not be used. One adjustment godoc 
          does do is to display indented text in a fixed-width font, suitable for program snippets. 
          The package comment for the fmt package uses this to good effect.

          The comments are uninterpreted plain text, so HTML and other 
          annotations such as _this_ and <this> will reproduce verbatim and should not be used.
